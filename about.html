        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm passionate about all things tech, especially programming and robotics. With a strong foundation in software development, Iâ€™m constantly learning new tools and technologies to build efficient and innovative solutions. My goal is to work in the software development or robotics field, where I can merge creativity with technical expertise to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>In addition to my tech skills, I have extensive experience in graphic design and have worked with Photoshop for several years. I also have some experience in video editing, allowing me to create engaging multimedia content.</p>
        <p>I also went to acting school for 9 years, and I have a lot of experience in public speaking, which has given me excellent communication skills and the ability to present ideas clearly and confidently. Whether it's coding a new project or delivering a presentation, I'm always eager to learn and grow.</p>
